# Wellbore Pressure calculation

## Introduction

**WINC_OnePager** provides analytical wellbore pressure estimation tools for assessing CO2 leakage risk through abandoned wells. This project was initially developed as part of the <a href="https://colab.equinor.com/technologies/4FAAF5BD-19C3-46A3-ACB6-5D38DD2C7A89/summary" target="_blank">SCREEN project</a>, but the analytical pressure estimation module has been developed and maintained as a separate, standalone entity.

The toolbox provides a series of script-based tools to assist risk assessment of legacy wells by computing pressure gradients and visualizing well construction data.
 
The toolbox can be grouped in two main modules: A **pre-processing and preliminary assessment**, and a **detailed simulation workflow** as shown in the figure below.

### Pre-processing and preliminary assesment

#### Data Preparation

The first step in using the WINC_OnePager toolbox is to gather all the necessary data. Sources of data include both subsurface data nearby well and specifics about the well construction. Some of this data can ba gathered from internal databases, but some other has to be retrieved manually. Whichever the method, the current solution requires the data to be collected on an input sheet (CSV or YAML file) with tables containing different datasets.

To collect the data these are some steps that can be followed:

•	*Identify the required data*: Review the list of required tables and columns in the input data file to determine what information you need to gather. This includes well header information, drilling intervals, casing and cementing intervals, barriers, geological units, and assumptions (see table below).

•	*Collect the data*: Involve both subsurface and well integrity experts involved on the project to provide curated datasets to be used in the evaluation. By doing this, we ensure data has been previously verified. Subsurface data can vary from simple well tops, temperature profiles to more specifics about the quality of the reservoirs involved, potential flow units in the overburden, and the current state of reservoir pressure in case it deviates from hydrostatic. A previous qualitative leakage risk assessment of the wells shall provide the necessary input relevant for the well.

•	*Organize the data*: Organize the data into tables according to the structure of the input data file. Use a spreadsheet program or a text editor to create a CSV file with multiple tables, each separated by a blank line. Ensure that all required tables and columns are included in the input data file and that the data is entered correctly.

•	*Include assumptions*: The assumptions depend on the stage of knowledge of the area. If there is a reservoir model in place, such model should be used to fill in the information for these tables. Otherwise, these should be discussed with the subsurface personnel involved in the project.

The input sheet could be defined as aither a YAML or a CSV file. It shall include the following tables:

### Data Visualization and Proxy-based Leakage Estimation

Once all the information is tabulated, it can be processed with a python script. The processing will store the data in memory and use it to produce a hybrid geological well-sketch and a pressure-depth plot displaying the fluid pressures of each phase and the minimum horizontal stress.

The well sketch combines both subsurface data and well engineering information. It serves as a starting point to identify the main leakage pathways and illustrate the main risks associated with the well.

The pressure plot, besides visualizing the provided pressure scenarios, has the necessary input to run a preliminary leakage estimation based on a Darcy-based proxy. This proxy gives an estimate of leakage rates through the main barrier (deepest cement plug). The magnitude will be a function of both the transport properties assigned to the barrier and the resulting phase pressures of each scenario.

## Detailed simulation workflow

For wells with larger uncertainties and more complex leakage pathways, a simulation-based approach can assist in generating a more accurate estimate of leakage.

By fulfilling the first two modules, the data is ready to be processed through a second script that generates and initializes a simple reservoir model with a finite-volume representation of the legacy well.

### Building the mesh
The generated mesh is a coarse mesh with `local grid refinement (LGR)` in the middle. The higher resolution of the LGR is used to represent well construction details.

Due to the cartesian nature of the mesh, the cylindrical shape of the well is turned into a prism. A horizontal cross-section of the well in the LGR is square, with sides meant to preserve the area of the original circle. However, discrepancies between volumes may occur due to mesh resolution.

The transport properties of geological units are inherited from coarse grid and updated to represent well. Open borehole is represented by high permeability grid cells. Cement plugs and cement-bond are represented by low permeability cells. Casing is represented by reduction of transmissibility of cell interfaces.
