# SCREEN

This repository contains source codes and documentation for SCREEN project.

[![SCREEN-docs](https://github.com/equinor/SCREEN/actions/workflows/mkdocs.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/equinor/SCREEN/actions/workflows/mkdocs.yaml)

## Clone the repository
Locate a folder at your local machine that you intend to investigate the codes, and then clone the repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/equinor/SCREEN
```
Note here `$` is a linux command prompt and therefore there is no need to type it. By this time you should have a folder named `SCREEN` at your local machine. Now change the directory with linux command:
```
$ cd SCREEN
```

It's normal for us to make a new branch if we indend to make some changes of the codes. This can be done with the `-b` option, for example:
```
$ git checkout -b xyz/cleanup
```
This would generate a new branch, named `xyz/cleanup`. Here the branch name is created by concatenating a short name, such as `xyz`,  of `equinor` account with a feature description `cleanup`. There is no need to follow this convention. You could simply pick any branch name as long as it makes sense. However, please note branch names have limitations.

## Virtual environment

It's a common practice to work on a project within a python virtual environment. I have been using python's builtin module `venv` for a long while. So I am going to stick to it here as an example to set up the virtual environment. But you are free to use any other virtual environment setups that you feel comfortable with, such as *poetry*, *conda*, etc. 
```
$ python -m venv venv_screen
```
This will build a virtual environment `venv_screen`. You only need to creat it once.

To activate this `venv_screen`, run the following command: 
```
$ source venv_screen/bin/activate.csh
```
when your linux Shell is `csh`. 

If you are using `bash` or plain `sh`, you can activate it with the following command:
```
$ source venv_screen/bin/activate
```

We pack needed python packages into a file, such as `requirements.txt`. And install those python packages to this virtual environment by running the following command:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You should now be ready to play with the source codes.

```
## Experiments
There are at least two ways to make experimenal runs of the codes. One is to run the experiments with Jupyter lab, and the other is commandline option. While Jupyter notebooks are mainly for QC tests and research purposes, the commandline option is aiming for production run.

### Jupyter notebooks
Jupyter notebooks are located in directory `notebooks`. To test its functionaries, change current directory to `notebooks` and launch jupyter notebooks at the commandline:
```
$ jupyter-lab
```
Or if you prefer, you can run these Jupyter notebooks from Microsoft's VS code.

There exist several Jupyter notebooks in the directory:

- Notebook **GaP-WellClass.ipynb** is a test example for the integration of `GaP` and `WellClass`. It hides many details. It require eclipse `.EGRID` and `.INIT` as input files. This notebook also serves the role of generating `pytest` data for unit testing.
- Notebook **pflotran-gap.ipynb** integrates `GaP` and `WellClass` too. But instead of the user-provided `.EGRID` and `.INIT` files, both files are generates by calling pflotran scripts.
- Notebook **Pressure-WellClass_test.ipynb** is Alejandro's tests on deviated wells.
- Notebook **Pressure-WellClass.ipynb** is used to test pressure. 
- Notebook **WellClass_csv_yaml.ipynb** is used to test pressure and loading `.csv` and `.yaml` input files.

### Commandline option
Two python scripts for commandline option are available in directory `experiments`. One script, **gap_plotran.py**, can be used not only for generating Eclipse `.EGRID` and `.INIT` on the fly but also can be used for quick `pflotran` test, while the other script, **gap_wellclass.py**, requires the user to provide these two grid files.  

The followings are some of  the sample runs. In either way, you should run the python script inside the ```SCREEN``` directory. 

1. To test **gap_wellclass.py**, run either of the followings:
```python
# 1. for smeaheia_v1

$ python -m experiments.gap_wellclass --sim-path ./test_data/examples/smeaheia_v1 --well smeaheia.yaml --sim-case GEN_NOLGR_PH2 --plot 

# 2. for smeaheia_v2

$ python -m experiments.gap_wellclass --sim-path ./test_data/examples/smeaheia_v2 --well smeaheia.yaml --sim-case TEMP-0 --plot

# 3. for cosmo

$ python -m experiments.gap_wellclass --sim-path ./test_data/examples/cosmo --well cosmo.yaml --sim-case TEMP-0 --plot

```
This will generate an output file `LEG_HIRES.grdecl` in `experiments` directory.

2. To test **gap_plotran.py**, run the following commnad at the directory ``SCREEN``:
```python
$ python -m experiments.gap_pflotran \
    --sim-path ./test_data/examples/cosmo-pflotran \
    --well cosmo.yaml \
    --sim-case1 TEMP-0_NOSIM \
    --sim-case2 TEMP-0 \
    --plot
```
## Test data
In order for quick test of the codes, we include some test data in the folder `test_data/examples`. The input data structure is organized  similiar to the `pflotran`. For example, for test data
`test_data/examples/cosmo-pflotran-2`, the input file structure should be like this:
```
├── cosmo.yaml
├── include
│   ├── co2_db_new.dat
│   ├── temperature_gradient.inc
│   ├── TEMP_GRD.grdecl
│   ├── TEMP_GRD_NOSIM.grdecl
│   └── tops_dz.inc
└── model
    ├── TEMP-0.in
    └── TEMP-0_NOSIM.in
```
Sub-directories, such as `cosmo`, `smeaheia_v1` and `smeaheia_v2`, contain the necessary data, e.g., Eclipse  `.EGRID` and `.INIT` files, for testing **gap_wellclass.py**. 

One sub-directory, `cosmo-plotran`, contains configuration parameters for testing **gap_pflotran.py**, i.e., use pfloatran to generate `.EGRID` and `.INIT`. 

Another sub-directory `frigg` contains information for testing deviated wells.

In addition, the **PVT** values are included in the directory `pvt_contants` for self-consistent testing of pressure-related computes.

## Unit testing and code coverage
We are using `pytest` for unit testing and code coverage. The unit testing utilizes `cosmo` as the testing example. So please make sure the saved .pkl files in ```test_data/examples/cosmo/pytest``` exists and is updated. Here is a commandline example:
```pyton
$ python -m pytest tests
```
This will report the unit testing results. And the following will report not only unit testing but also code coverage:
```python
$ python -m pytest --cov tests
```
or a litle bit more complex command:
```python
$ python -m pytest --cov --cov-branch --cov-report term-missing tests
```

## Documentation

The document can be automatically generated and deployed to github pages. To do that, type the following at the command line:
```
$ mkdocs gh-deploy
```
It may take some minutes until the documentation goes live. And the generated documentation page can be found at [SCREEN docs](https://redesigned-dollop-m5l6pme.pages.github.io/).
